Variables
Global Variables are all controlled through the files in the data section

Entity ID:
P00001 represents person 1
H00001 represents hosue 1
L00001 represents other location 1 (exercise place, etc)
EW00001 represents essential workplace 1
NW00001 represents nonessential workplace 1

Number of houses is dynamically generated by 'filling' up population until each person has a house


Average Job Produces about 28 Jobs, therefore to find uptimal number of job sites 
((Unemployment Rate * Percent of people old enough to work) / Avg number of jobs per workplace) * jobBuffer = Number of necessary Jobs 

Number of other places (exercise locations, etc)
(Population / Number of households) * Number of workplaces 


minJobAge = the minimum age someone can be to get a job
maxJobAge = the maximum age someone can be to get a job
ableCount = how many people are able to work (between minJobAge and maxJobAge)


JSON file makeup
general = General stats about town (population, workPlaceCount, etc)
people = Contains all the data about each person in the town (gender, id, age, etc)
workplace = Contains all the data about each workplace (ageDistro, workerList, etc)
house = Contains all the data about each house (Resident count and list)
location = Contains all the necessary data for each other-location

Sim terminology
A period is the smallest amount of time a resident can do something

The days someone goes to work is determined in the 'generateWorkPlan' function. 
The times someone is at work is generated randomly based of a curve with;
The peak being = (days to work per week) + 3
With the max variation being  = ((days to work per week) + 3) / 4

So for a job working 5 days a week;
Peak = 5 + 3
     = 8
variation = (+-) 8 / 4
          = (+-) 2

Job times are calculated to try and be between 9am to 5pm so that workStart and workEnd are 
equal distance from dayStart and dayEnd

Exercise 
People exercise more on weekends (determined by the weekendmultiplier value)
People only exercise on weekdays when they are free to do so and will prioritise shopping and work over exercising


Health score 
0 is 100% healthy
1 is dead, death can happen if healthScore is above 0.9, IF this occurs the chance of death is given by healthScore
Fluctuation score is the probability on a day that someone will fill unwell AND gives the bell curve for the degree to which they are sick
